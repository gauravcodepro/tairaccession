This package has added utilities for analyzing also the Phytozome datasets and also you can plot the desried genes of interest.
- You can also analyze [Phytozome Araport](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov) also using this package.The package is under release at PyPI package repository.
- I have updated this package with additional support for the phytozome in addition to the tair.
- In an update to this package, few functions on plotting the coding regions, gene regions and exons have been added.
- There are additional functions such ```prepareFunctionalNamePhytozome```and ```preparegeneNamePhytozome```which will automatically prepare the files as per the release of the phytozome and tair.
